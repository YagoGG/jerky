yamole
======

Dig through the JSON references inside a YAML file, the kind of situation
you may run into when parsing [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) files.

The result is a single, big YAML file with all the references resolved (i.e.
with their contents replaced in the corresponding places).
